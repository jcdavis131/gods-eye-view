// Zoning API: the district a city's own zoning GIS puts a point in, and the
// district outlines around a view, for the ten largest-city services wired in
// lib/zoning. CORS open, edge-cached, with the shared envelope
// (lib/server/respond.ts).
//
//   /api/zoning?op=point&lon=..&lat=..    the district at a point: code, the city's own
//                                         description and category, overlays, ordinance,
//                                         effective date, code link. The city comes from
//                                         the Census incorporated place under the point.
//                                         States: district | right-of-way | no-district |
//                                         no-ordinance (Houston) | not-covered.
//   /api/zoning?op=districts&bbox=w,s,e,n district outlines (code and colour family only)
//                                         from every covered city the box meets, box at
//                                         most 0.04 degrees, snapped to 0.0025.
//   /api/zoning?op=coverage               which cities answer points, which draw outlines,
//                                         and why the rest do not.
//
// Zoning maps change by ordinance, a few times a month at most, so answers are
// held for a day and the edge keeps them for an hour.
