// The top of the sitemap tree: the globe and the three hubs, by hand.
//
// Everything else is sharded into its own segment — /place/sitemap/N.xml,
// /metro/sitemap.xml, /state/sitemap.xml — and enumerated from app/robots.ts.
// This file stays four lines long on purpose, because it is the one a person
// opens to check the deployment is pointing at the right origin.
//
// No brief URL appears in any sitemap, here or in a shard. A brief with no
// findings renders noindex, and listing URLs that answer noindex is the
// fastest way to teach a crawler to stop believing the file. Briefs are
// discovered by the in-content link on their place page instead.
//
// lastModified is never new Date() per request. At build time we genuinely do
// not know when a place's content last changed — the numbers arrive at render
// time from upstreams with their own release calendars — so the honest stamp
// is the manifest pull, and the build date only when there has been no pull.
