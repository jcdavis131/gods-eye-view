// A metropolitan statistical area as a document.
//
// The substantial offline core of this page is the occupation mix. BLS OEWS
// publishes its occupation tables per CBSA and lib/economy/oews.ts holds them
// as committed JSON, so the top 30 detailed occupations and all 22 SOC major
// groups render in full with no egress at all. That is why the page is worth
// serving even when every live upstream is unreachable.
//
// Everything that does need the network says so in words. Zillow's metro files
// are keyed by RegionID and the manifest may not have resolved one, in which
// case the housing section reads "unavailable" with that reason rather than
// guessing a row by name. And BLS publishes no metro employment total at the
// aggregation levels this app reads — qcewSectors handles SSCCC / SS000 /
// US000 at agglvl 74 / 54 / 14 and nothing else — so the employment figure is
// an explicit county rollup that prints its own arithmetic and NAMES the
// counties it could not count instead of treating them as zero.
//
// Ethics: places and institutions only. Nothing here addresses a parcel, an
// address, an owner, an officer or an insider.
