// Levels for a place, written down.
//
// This closes a real gap rather than restating one. Nothing in the screener
// marks a county field as watch or alert, and of the nineteen registered
// indicators ten are national, five are river gauges, exactly one is
// state-scoped (Texas) and none is keyed to a county — so a place page has no
// existing rule to inherit. PLACE_THRESHOLDS is that rule table, hand-written,
// mirroring lib/indicators/types.ts Threshold so the two read the same.
//
// `on` says which quantity the rule tests, and therefore how the sentence
// phrases the period:
//   value   — the metric as published, at its own scale.
//   yoyPct  — a metric that is itself an over-the-year percent change.
//   momPct  — a metric that is itself a month-over-month percent change,
//             derived from the Zillow month columns (home.momPct, rent.momPct).
//   pct     — the entity's POSITION among its national peers, read off the
//             cohort table. This is how a brief is specific about a level
//             nobody official publishes: "in the top tenth of US counties" is
//             a claim about the data that is true or false, where "expensive"
//             is not.
//
// Every entry carries a non-empty citation, and where the level is ours the
// citation says so in the repo's existing words. Printing a label without its
// citation would imply an official level that does not exist.
