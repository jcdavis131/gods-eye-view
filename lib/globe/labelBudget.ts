// Label discipline: a screen-space budget and a collision pass for every
// globe label, across layers.
//
// Each layer decides which of its features deserve a label (hover, selection,
// small layers, "always" features). Left alone, several layers at once flood a
// phone: weather readings, venues, places and constructs pile on top of each
// other and run off the right edge. This pass sees every candidate at once, in
// screen space, and keeps the most important ones that fit: inside the frame,
// clear of the HUD, clear of each other, within a budget that scales with the
// screen. A label that cannot fit is dropped whole, never squashed or clipped.
// Pure, so the rules are tested without a globe.
