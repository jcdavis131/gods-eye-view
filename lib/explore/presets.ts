// Curated starting points. Each one is just a permalink: a place, a height
// and which layers to switch on. The blurbs say what the layers will show
// there, not facts about the water; the data loads live when you arrive.
//
// Every preset below was probed against the USGS Water Data API on
// 2026-09-10 (gauges and wells inside a one-degree box) before it was
// listed, so none of them lands on an empty map. The hazards & land presets
// were probed on 2026-09-25 with the exact box each layer requests. Fires
// move, so the wildfire preset has no fixed place: it resolves when clicked.
// The terrain & soils presets were probed on 2026-09-26 at the point each one
// asks about (Soil Data Access, the WHP identify on a 0.05° grid, the NOAA
// 3 ft tile over Galveston Island, 3DEP EPQS and the contour render).
// The infrastructure, air and events presets were probed on 2026-09-26 by
// running each layer's own fetch at the preset's view against /api/infra,
// /api/cameras, /api/air and /api/events, so the counts in their blurbs are
// what that box held that day.
// The parcel presets were probed on 2026-09-26 through /api/parcels with the
// outline box the layer asks for at their height and an identify at the
// target; each opens the record of a publicly owned parcel.
