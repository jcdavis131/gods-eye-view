// Emergence: the constructs world takes its state from the physical one.
//
// A construct has no sensors of its own. What it "knows" is what the physical
// layers put inside it: the gauges in a watershed, the aircraft over a
// district right now, the companies and bank offices in a county, the
// earthquakes in an ecoregion today. This module turns the loaded physical
// features into vitals per construct: counts by layer, density per 1,000 km²,
// and a heat in 0..1 relative to the other constructs in view. The field
// layer is drawn from those vitals, so it changes as the physical twin does.
//
// Rules kept: simulated features (the traffic layer) are never counted; only
// features with a point position are placed (polygon layers are constructs of
// their own, not things inside one); counts are of what is loaded in the
// browser now, and every place that shows them says so.
