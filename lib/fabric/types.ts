// Place fabric: the constructs a point sits inside.
//
// The physical layers (aircraft, gauges, wells, harbours) are things you can
// point at. The constructs are the human and scientific frames laid over the
// same ground: the county that governs it, the district that votes for it,
// the watershed it drains through, the ecoregion it belongs to, the flood zone
// it was mapped into, the weather office that forecasts it, the federal
// region that administers it. A point is where all of those meet, so the
// point is the join key: every point of view on the globe is tied to every
// other through the constructs they share.
//
// Everything here is pure data shapes; lib/fabric/parse.ts fills them from
// the upstreams and lib/fabric/graph.ts orders and links them.
