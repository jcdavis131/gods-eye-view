// Layer: flood zones. FEMA's regulatory flood map around the camera
// target: which ground is inside the 1 % annual-chance floodplain, the base
// flood elevation where FEMA published one, and the FIRM database it comes from.
//
//   FEMA NFHL layer 28   flood hazard zones (S_FLD_HAZ_AR) through /api/land,
//                        which retries FEMA's connection resets and caches each
//                        snapped box for a day
//
// FEMA itself draws these only finer than about 1:36,000, so the layer loads
// below FLOOD_MAX_HEIGHT_M. It is a regulatory map, not a forecast: it says
// nothing about whether anything is flooding now (the Surface water layer's
// NWS flood categories do that).
//
// Zones are loaded for one box around the camera target (the largest the
// route serves), and that box is drawn as a dashed outline: ground outside it
// is not loaded, which must never read as "not in a floodplain".
