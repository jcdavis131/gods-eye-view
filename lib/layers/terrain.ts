// Layers: terrain, soils, land cover and the long-range hazard pictures.
//
// These are picture layers: each is tiled imagery its publisher renders
// (lib/terrain/products.ts has every source, lib/globe/terrainStyles.ts how
// each is drawn), so fetch() makes no request of its own. It reports whether
// the camera is inside the layer's height band and what the picture is and is
// not, and passes the scenario the style draws (the sea level rise feet).
// A click on the ground while any of them is on opens a "ground here" dossier
// with the value under the click (lib/terrain/ground.ts).
