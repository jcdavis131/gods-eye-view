// One source of truth for absolute URLs and the shared metadata defaults.
//
// The app has two root layouts (app/(globe) and app/(docs)) and neither sits
// under the other, so there is no inherited metadataBase to lean on: the
// sitemaps, robots.txt, feeds and JSON-LD all have to build absolute URLs from
// the same constant or they will disagree with each other. Everything here is
// pure and environment-only, so it is safe to import from a route handler, a
// server component and a build-time sitemap alike.
//
// BASE_METADATA deliberately carries no title. A title set here would be
// inherited as a plain string by both roots, and the docs root needs a title
// template while the globe root needs a bare string that keeps the home page's
// rendered <title> byte-identical to what it was before the split.
